# Motivation

So far we’ve been working with data sets that have been already cleaned, and can be imported in R ready to be analyzed.

Today we are going to deal with a “messy” dataset. Most real life data sets require a pre-processing phase, and most of the time spent in any data analysis project will involve getting the data in the right shape. So it is extremely important that you gain skills for cleaning raw data.

## Packages "stringr", "plotly", and regex cheatsheet

For this lab, you will be using the R packages "stringr" and "plotly"

```{r}
# you may need to install the packages
# install.packages("stringr")
# install.packages("plotly")
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(plotly)
```

Also, while you work on this lab you may want to look at the cheat sheets for:

* stringr
* regex
* plotly

# Mobile Food Schedule Data

Before downloading the data, create a folder for this lab:

* Create a new directory, e.g. lab10
* cd to lab10

The data file for this lab is on the github repo:

[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucb-stat133/stat133-spring-2018/master/data/mobile-food-sf.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucb-stat133/stat133-spring-2018/master/data/mobile-food-sf.csv)

The original source is the Mobile Food Facility Permit data, which comes from DataSF (SF Open Data):

[https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Schedule/jjew-r69b](https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Schedule/jjew-r69b)

## Get your own copy of the data

Download a copy of the file to your working directory. Here’s the code wiht R’s download.file() function (or you could also use curl from the command line):

```{r}
github <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucb-stat133/stat133-spring-2018/master/"
datafile <- "data/mobile-food-sf.csv"
download.file(paste0(github, datafile), destfile = "mobile-food-sf.csv")
```

## Import data table in R

Once you’ve downloaded the data file, you can read it in R:

```{r}
dat <- read.csv('mobile-food-sf.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

The variables are:

* DayOfWeekStr
* starttime
* endtime
* PermitLocation
* optionaltext
* ColdTruck
* Applicant
* Location

# Plots with "plotly"

Let’s begin using functions from the package "plotly" which allows you to produce nice interactive graphics rendered in html form. Keep in mind the plotly graphs will work as long as your output document is in html format (i.e. knitting html_document is okay). However plotly graphs WON’T work when knitting github_output.

Consider the variable DayOfWeekStr which contains the day of the week in string format. Let’s calculate the frequencies (i.e. counts) of the categories in this column and visualize them with a bar-chart:

```{r}
day_freqs <- table(dat$DayOfWeekStr)

barplot(day_freqs, border = NA, las = 3)
```

An alternative bar-chart can be obtained with "plotly". You can use the function plot_ly() in a similar way to base-R plot():

```{r}
plot_ly(x = names(day_freqs), 
        y = day_freqs,
        type = 'bar')
```

Interestingly, you can also use plot_ly() in a similar way to ggplot(). To use plot_ly() in this way, the data to be graphed must have the in data.frame (or tibble):

```{r}
# day frequencies table
day_counts <- dat %>% 
  select(DayOfWeekStr) %>%
  group_by(DayOfWeekStr) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

day_counts
```

Having obtained day_counts, you can pass it to plot_ly() and then map the columns DayOfWeekStr and Count to the x and y attributes, and the type = 'bar' argument:
```{r}
plot_ly(day_counts, 
        x = ~DayOfWeekStr, 
        y = ~count,
        type = 'bar')
```

Notice the use of the tilder "~" to specify the mapping, that is: linking a visual attribute with the column name from a data frame.

To order the bars in increasing order, you need to reorder() the values on the x-axis:
```{r}
plot_ly(day_counts, 
        x = ~reorder(DayOfWeekStr, count), 
        y = ~count,
        type = 'bar')
```

# Changing Times

Let’s begin processing the values in column starttime. The goal is to obtain new times in 24 hr format. For example, a starting time of 10AM will be transformed to 10:00. Likewise, a starting time of 1PM will be transformed to 13:00.

We are going to be manipulating character strings. Hence, I recommend that you start working on a small subset of values. Figure out how to get the answers working on this subset, and then generalize to the entire data set.

Consider the first starting time that has a value of 10AM. To get a better feeling of string manipulation, let’s create a toy string with this value:

```{r}
# toy string
time1 <- '10AM'
```

## Function str_sub()

To get the time and period values, you can use str_sub():
```{r}
# hour
str_sub(time1, start = 1, end = 2)

# period
str_sub(time1, start = 3, end = 4)
```

**Your turn**: What about times where the hour has just one digit? For example: 9AM, or 8AM? Create the following vector times and try to subset the hour and the periods with str_sub()

```{r}
times <- c('12PM', '10AM', '9AM', '8AM', '2PM')

# subset time
str_sub(times, -4, -3)

# subset period
str_sub(times, start = -2)

```

One nice thing about str_sub() is that it allows you to specify negative values for the start and end positions. Run the command below and see what happens:

```{r}
# period
str_sub(times, start = -2)
```


## Function str_replace()

The tricky part with the vector times is the extraction of the hour. One solution is to “remove” the characters AM or PM from each time. You can do this with the substitution function str_replace():

```{r}
str_replace(times, pattern = 'AM|PM', replacement = '')
```

## Your Turn

So far you’ve managed to get the hour value and the period (AM or PM). Now:

Using times, create a numeric vector hours containing just the number time (i.e. hour)
```{r}
hours <- as.numeric(str_replace(times, pattern = 'AM|PM', replacement = ''))
```

Using times, create a character vector periods containing the period, e.g. AM or PM
```{r}
periods <- str_sub(times, start = -2)
```

Use plot_ly() to make a barchart of the counts for AM and PM values.
```{r}
plot_ly(x = c("AM", "PM"), 
        y = table(periods),
        type = 'bar')
```

Write R code to create a vector start24 that contains the hour in 24hr scale.
```{r}
start24 <- hours
which_pm <- periods == 'PM' & hours != 12
start24[which_pm] <- hours[which_pm] + 12
```

Add two columns start and end to the data frame dat, containing the starting and ending hour respectively (columns must be "numeric").
```{r}
start_hours <- as.numeric(str_replace(dat$starttime, pattern = 'AM|PM', replacement = ''))
start_periods <- str_sub(dat$starttime, start = -2)

start_table <- table(start_periods) / length(start_periods)

start_df <- data.frame(
  x = start_hours,
  y = start_periods
)

p <- plot_ly(data = start_df, x = ~x, y = ~y,
  type = "bar"
)
p


p <- plot_ly(
  x = names(start_table),
  y = start_table,
  #name = "Periods",
  type = "bar"
)
p

end_hours <- as.numeric(str_replace(dat$endtime, pattern = 'AM|PM', replacement = ''))
end_periods <- str_sub(dat$endtime, start = -2)
```

With the starting and ending hours, calculate the duration, and add one more column duration to the data frame dat:
```{r}

# add column start
which_start_pm <- start_periods == 'PM' & start_hours != 12
sh <- start_hours
sh[which_start_pm] <- start_hours[which_start_pm] + 12
dat$start <- sh

# add column end
which_end_pm <- end_periods == 'PM' & end_hours != 12
eh <- end_hours
eh[which_end_pm] <- end_hours[which_end_pm] + 12
dat$end <- eh

# add column duration
dat$duration <- eh - sh
```


# Latitude and Longitude Coordinates

Another interesting column in the data is Location. If you look at this column, you will see values like the following string loc1

```{r}
loc1 <- "(37.7651967350509,-122.416451692902)"
```

The goal is to split Location into latitude and longitude. The first value corresponds to latitude, while the second value corresponds to longitude.

First we need to remove the parenthesis. The issue here is that the characters ( and ) have special meanings; recall they are metacharacters. So you need to escape in R them by pre-appending two backslashes: \\( and \\)

```{r}
# "remove" opening parenthesis 
str_replace(loc1, pattern = '\\(', replacement = '')
# "remove" closing parenthesis
str_replace(loc1, pattern = '\\)', replacement = '')
```

You can also combine both patterns in a single call. But be careful:

```{r}
str_replace(loc1, pattern = '\\(|\\)', replacement = '')
```

str_replace() replaces only the first occurrence of ( or ). However, the location values contain both opening and closing parentheses. To replace them all, you have to use str_replace_all()

```{r}
str_replace_all(loc1, pattern = '\\(|\\)', replacement = '')
```

Now we need to get rid of the comma ,. You could replace it with an empty string, but then you will end up with one long string like this:

```{r}
lat_lon <- str_replace_all(loc1, pattern = '\\(|\\)', replacement = '')

str_replace(lat_lon, pattern = ',', replacement = '')
```

Instead of replacing the comma, what we need to use is str_split()

```{r}
# string split in stringr
str_split(lat_lon, pattern = ',')
```

Notice that str_split() returns a list.

## Manipulating more location values

Let’s define a vector with more location values, so we can start generalizing our code:

```{r}
locs <- c(
  "(37.7651967350509,-122.416451692902)",
  "(37.7907890558203,-122.402273431333)",
  "(37.7111991003088,-122.394693339395)",
  "(37.7773000262759,-122.394812784799)",
  NA
)
```

* use str_split() to create a list lat_lon containing the latitude and the longitude values of locs
```{r}

# "removing" parentheses
locs_temp <- str_replace_all(locs, pattern = '\\(|\\)', replacement = '')

# list of latitude and longitude values
lat_long <- str_split(locs_temp, pattern = ',')

# apply it to entire data
locs_temp <- str_replace_all(dat$Location, pattern = '\\(|\\)', replacement = '')

lat_lon <- str_split(locs_temp, pattern = ',')
```

Assuming that you have lat_lon, to retrieve the latitude and longitude values, you can use the lapply() function, and then specify an anonymous function to get the first element (for the latitude):
```{r}
lat <- lapply(lat_lon, function(x) x[1])
```


### Your Turn

Create a list lon by using lapply() with an anonymous function to extract longitude value (i.e. the second element):
```{r}
# numeric vectors of latitude and longitude values
lon <- lapply(lat_lon, function(x) x[2])
```

To convert from list to a vector, use unlist()
```{r}
lat <- as.numeric(unlist(lat))
lon <- as.numeric(unlist(lon))
```

Add two more columns: lat and lon to the data frame dat
```{r}
dat$lon <- lon
dat$lat <- lat
```

# Plotting locations on a map

Now that you have two vectors latitude and longitude, and the corresponding columns lat and lon in the data frame dat, let’s try to plot those coordinates on a map.

A naive option would be to graph the locations with plot():
```{r}
plot(dat$lon, dat$lat, pch = 19, col = "#77777744")
```

## Scatterplots with "plotly"

A similar scatterplot can be obtained with plot_ly() which, as we’ve seen, can be used like base-R plot():
```{r, message = FALSE, warning= FALSE}
# default scatterplot
plot_ly(x = lon, y = lat)
```

but it’s recommended to specify arguments type = 'scatter' and mode = 'markers':
```{r, message = FALSE, warning= FALSE}
# default scatterplot
plot_ly(x = lon, y = lat, type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers')
```

Because lon and lat are also in the data frame dat, you could use plot_ly() in a similar (although not identical) way to ggplot():

```{r, message = FALSE, warning= FALSE}
plot_ly(data = dat, x = ~lon, y = ~lat, type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers')
```

Notice the use of the tildes next to x and y arguments. This is what plot_ly() uses to map the values of a column (in a data.frame) as the attributes of a graphical element.

# Maps with "RgoogleMaps"

Although the previous calls show the dots with the right latitude and longitude coordinates, there’s no visual cues that let us perceive the information in a geographical way.

Instead of displaying a naked plot(), we can use the package "RgoogleMaps" which is one the several packages available in R to plot maps.

```{r}
# install.packages("RgoogleMaps")
library(RgoogleMaps)
```

To get a map you use the function GetMap() which requires a center and a zoom specifications. The center is a vector with the latitude and longitude coordinates. The argument zoom refers to the zoom level.

```{r}
# coordinates for center of the map
center <- c(mean(dat$lat, na.rm = TRUE), mean(dat$lon, na.rm = TRUE))

# zoom value
zoom <- min(MaxZoom(range(dat$lat, na.rm = TRUE), 
                    range(dat$lon, na.rm = TRUE)))

# san francisco map
map1 <- GetMap(center=center, zoom=zoom, destfile = "san-francisco.png")
```

The code above downloads a static map from the Google server and saves it in the specified destination file. To make a plot you have to use PlotOnStaticMap()

```{r}
PlotOnStaticMap(map1, dat$lat, dat$lon, col = "#ed4964", pch=20)
```

## Maps with "ggmap"

Another useful package for plotting maps is "ggmap". As you may guess, "ggmap" follows the graphing approach of "ggplot2".

As usual, you need to install the package:

```{r}
# remember to install ggmap
library(ggmap)
```

It is possible that you run into some issues with "ggmap" (and "ggplot2"). Apparently, there are a couple of conflicting bugs in some versions of these packages. If you encounter some cryptic errors, you may switch to an older version of "ggplot2"

```{r}
# skip this part (come back if you run into some error messages)
# (go back to a previous version of ggplot)
# devtools::install_github("hadley/ggplot2@v2.2.0")
# devtools::install_github("dkahle/ggmap")
```

Here I’m assuming that the data frame dat already includes columns lat and lon:

Because some rows have missing values in the geographical coordinates, we can get rid of them with 'na.omit():
```{r}
# let's get rid of rows with missing values
dat <- na.omit(dat)
```

In order to plot a map with ggmap(), we need to define the region of the map via the function make_bbox():

```{r}
# ggmap typically asks you for a zoom level, 
# but we can try using ggmap's make_bbox function:
sbbox <- make_bbox(lon = dat$lon, lat = dat$lat, f = .1)
sbbox
```

Now that you have the object sbbox, the next step is to get a map with get_map(). This function gets a map from Google by default.

```{r}
# get a 'terrain' map
sf_map <- get_map(location = sbbox, maptype = "terrain", source = "google")
```

Having obtained the sf_map object, we can finally use ggmap() to plot some dots with our lat and lon coordinates:

```{r}
ggmap(sf_map) + 
  geom_point(data = dat, 
             mapping = aes(x = lon, y = lat), 
             color = "red", alpha = 0.2, size = 1)
```

# Let’s look for specific types of food

The data table dat contains a column optionaltext describing the types of food and meals served by the food trucks. Let’s take a look at the first 3 elements:

```{r}
dat$optionaltext[1:3]
```

Notice that the first element (i.e. the first food truck) prepares Tacos, Burritos, Tortas, Quesadillas, etc.

What if you want to identify all locations that have burritos? This is where regular expressions comes very handy. Again, always start small: select the first 10 elements of optionaltext

```{r}
foods <- dat$optionaltext[1:10]
```

* Use str_detect() (or equivalently grep()) to match "Burritos" and "burritos".
```{r}
library(stringr)

food <- dat$optionaltext
foods[str_detect(foods, 'urritos')]
```

* If you use grepl(), you can use ignore.case = TRUE to match for both.
```{r}
grepl('urritos', foods, ignore.case = TRUE)
```

* Try another pattern: e.g. "tacos", or "quesadillas"
```{r}
foods[str_detect(foods, 'acos')]

foods[str_detect(foods, 'uesadillas')]
```

* Now create a data frame burritos by subsetting (i.e. filtering) the data frame to get only those rows that match "burritos"
```{r}
burritos_df <- dat %>%
  filter(str_detect(food, 'urritos'))
```

* Use the lat and lon corrdinates in burritos to display a map of locations with burritos (see map below).
```{r}
ggmap(sf_map) + 
  geom_point(data = burritos_df, 
             mapping = aes(x = lon, y = lat), 
             color = "red", alpha = 0.2, size = 1)
```

* Challenge: try use facetting to show a type of food per facet (e.g. one facet for burritos, another for quesadillas, another one for tacos, etc)
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tacos_df <- dat %>%
  filter(str_detect(food, 'acos'))

quesadillas_df <- dat %>%
  filter(str_detect(food, 'uesadillas'))

ggmap(sf_map) + 
  geom_point(data = burritos_df, 
             mapping = aes(x = lon, y = lat), 
             color = "red", alpha = 0.2, size = 1) +
  geom_point(data = tacos_df, 
             mapping = aes(x = lon, y = lat), 
             color = "blue", alpha = 0.2, size = 1) + 
  geom_point(data = quesadillas_df, 
             mapping = aes(x = lon, y = lat), 
             color = "green", alpha = 0.2, size = 1)
```
